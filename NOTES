NOTES for HTML::Truncate

20051227

Support images being included or left out as [IMG] (user supplied) or
"alt text" with a period after if it doesn't already contain one.
Callback? Yeah, otherwise they can't do delimiters, etc.

Move char counting into its own sub.

20051225

Support a <more /> and <more></more> system? The second is easy
because you just add 'more' to skip tags and then return everything
else.

Turn on an ellipsis for skipped parts? Allow it to be defined for all,
one scalar, or per tag with a hash leaving out those going
unspecified. Or something like
 <p>this</p><object></object><p>that</p>
 <p>this...</p><p>...that</p>
is more sane because it won't break layouts.

Need a way to complain/croak for things like <p>asdf<p>asdf. A can
contain itself flag or something for div and not for much else.

Considering overloading object to print itself as the truncated HTML
after truncate() has been done. Makes more sense to me than a new
method to get it.

Turn on "whole doc" excerpting...? To allow the header tags and then
only count text in the body.

Considered adding auto-detect for utf8 if declaration and meta info
are present and agree. But now only noting it so I don't decide it's a
great idea in six months because it's not.

Also pointed at HTML::FillInForm source which I still need to read.
