NOTES for HTML::Truncate

20051222

Turn on "whole doc" excerpting...? To allow the header tags and then
only count text in the body.

Considered adding auto-detect for utf8 if declaration and meta info
are present and agree. But now only noting it so I don't decide it's a
great idea in six months because it's not.

Also pointed at HTML::FillInForm source which I still need to read.
